## What is PATCH?

PATCH is a rock-solid, professional, all-in-one, smart and clean solution for managing your game's updates!

Your players can finally update their copies of your game with no pain or headaches, without having to download the whole game again when a new version comes. This will save them a lot of bandwidth and time!

It comes with Unity integration, but even with standalone tools: you can use it with every game engine.
