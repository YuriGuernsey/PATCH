# InnoSetup Sample

Open the `Updater-Installer.iss` (you can place it in the `PATCHWorkspace` folder) script with InnoSetup and configure the variables in the top section of the file to fit your use case.

Then place your Updater files in the `Updater` folder, like explained in the documentation.

In InnoSetup, hit the `Compile` button (or `Ctrl + F9`).

The installer will be located in the `Output` folder.
